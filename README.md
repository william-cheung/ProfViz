# ProfViz

ProfViz is a pstats viewer developed using [PyQt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/).
    
Pstats files are generated by profilers (cProfile and profile) in Python Standard Library. ProfViz can be used to view pstats files and can display useful diagrams for optimizing your Python code. You may need a [GraphViz] (www.graphviz.org) installation on your system for displaying callgraph. Enjoy it ! :)

The column headings:
- __func__   function name
- __file:ln__  position of the definition
- __ncall__  the number of calls
- __tottime__  the total time spent in the given function (and excluding time made in calls to sub-functions)
- __percall__  the quotient of tottime divided by ncall
- __cumtime__  the cumulative time spent in this and all subfunctions (from invocation till exit)
- __percall__  the quotient of cumtime divided by ncall
- __pct__  overall percentage of the cumtime
