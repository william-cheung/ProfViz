# ProfViz

ProfViz is a pstats viewer developed using [PyQt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/).
    
Pstats files are generated by profilers (\'cProfile\' and \'profile\') in Python Standard Library. ProfViz can be used to view pstats files and can display useful diagrams for optimizing your Python code. You may need a [GraphViz] (www.graphviz.org) installation on your system for displaying callgraph. Enjoy it ! :)
